# Backtester System: Comprehensive Design Document

## 1. System Overview

Our backtester is a modular, event-driven system designed for testing trading strategies using historical data. It's built to be flexible, scalable, and capable of handling complex strategies across multiple assets. The system is composed of several key modules that communicate through a central event bus, allowing for loose coupling and easy extensibility.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Event Bus

The Event Bus is the central communication mechanism of the system, implemented using ZeroMQ for high-performance, asynchronous messaging.

Key features:
- Publish-subscribe pattern for inter-module communication
- Supports multiple event types (e.g., NEW_DATA, SIGNAL, ORDER, FILL, OPTIMIZATION)
- Allows for easy addition of new modules and event types

### 2.2 Data Handler

Responsible for managing all aspects of market data within the system.

Key responsibilities:
- Fetching historical data from various sources
- Preprocessing and cleaning data
- Managing different data types (tick data, OHLCV, etc.)
- Providing data to other modules on request
- Generating NEW_DATA events

### 2.3 Strategy Handler

Implements trading strategies and generates trading signals.

Key responsibilities:
- Implementing various trading strategies
- Consuming market data events
- Generating entry and exit signals
- Publishing SIGNAL events
- Requesting strategy optimization

### 2.4 Portfolio Handler

Manages the current state of the portfolio and implements risk management rules.

Key responsibilities:
- Tracking current positions and cash balance
- Implementing risk management rules
- Handling position sizing
- Generating order requests based on signals and current portfolio state
- Publishing ORDER events

### 2.5 Order Layer

Simulates order execution for backtesting and paper trading.

Key responsibilities:
- Simulating order execution
- Implementing different order types (market, limit, stop, etc.)
- Handling slippage and transaction costs
- Publishing FILL events

### 2.6 Performance & Reporting Module

Calculates performance metrics and generates reports.

Key responsibilities:
- Calculating various performance metrics (returns, Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, etc.)
- Generating performance reports
- Providing visualization of results
- Storing and managing historical performance data

### 2.7 Optimization Engine

Tunes parameters for both strategies and portfolio management.

Key responsibilities:
- Defining parameter spaces for strategies and portfolio settings
- Implementing various optimization algorithms
- Running multiple backtests with different parameters
- Evaluating results and publishing optimized parameters

### 2.8 Market Simulator

Generates synthetic market data for testing strategies under various conditions.

Key responsibilities:
- Implementing models for generating price movements
- Simulating specific market scenarios or regimes
- Injecting anomalies or extreme events

## 3. System Workflow

1. The Data Handler fetches and preprocesses historical data, publishing NEW_DATA events to the Event Bus.
2. The Strategy Handler consumes NEW_DATA events, applies its trading logic, and publishes SIGNAL events when entry or exit conditions are met.
3. The Portfolio Handler receives SIGNAL events, evaluates them against the current portfolio state and risk management rules, and generates ORDER events.
4. The Order Layer simulates the execution of orders based on ORDER events and publishes FILL events.
5. The Portfolio Handler updates its state based on FILL events.
6. The Performance & Reporting Module continuously calculates and updates performance metrics based on portfolio changes and generates reports.
7. The Optimization Engine periodically runs to tune strategy and portfolio parameters, publishing optimization results which are consumed by relevant modules.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 Event-Driven Architecture
- Allows for real-time processing and reaction to market events
- Facilitates easy integration of new components
- Enables parallel processing of events

### 4.2 Modular Design
- Each component has clear, specific responsibilities
- Modules can be developed, tested, and updated independently
- Facilitates reuse across different types of testing (backtesting, paper trading, live trading)

### 4.3 Extensibility
- New data sources, strategies, and asset classes can be easily added
- Additional analysis or reporting modules can be integrated without modifying existing components

### 4.4 Optimization Capabilities
- Strategies and portfolio management can be optimized using various algorithms
- Supports walk-forward optimization and out-of-sample testing

### 4.5 Realistic Simulations
- Incorporates transaction costs and slippage
- Supports complex order types and portfolio constraints
- Can simulate various market conditions using the Market Simulator

## 5. Future Enhancements

1. API Layer: Implement a RESTful API for external system integration
2. Persistence Layer: Add capability to save and load system state
3. Multi-Asset Support: Enhance to handle multiple asset classes simultaneously
4. Machine Learning Integration: Incorporate ML models for prediction and optimization
5. Real-Time Data Streaming: Add support for live data feeds for paper trading and live trading
6. Distributed Computing: Implement support for running backtests across multiple machines

## 6. Conclusion

This backtester system provides a robust, flexible framework for developing and testing trading strategies. Its modular, event-driven design allows for easy expansion and modification, while the incorporation of advanced features like parameter optimization and market simulation enables thorough strategy evaluation under various conditions.
