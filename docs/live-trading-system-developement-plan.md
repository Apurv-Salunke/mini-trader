# Live Trading System Development Plan

## 1. Real-time Data Handling
- Modify DataHandler to support real-time data feeds
- Implement connection to a live market data provider (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, or a broker API)
- Develop methods for streaming and processing live market data

## 2. Order Execution System
- Design and implement an OrderExecutor class
- Connect to a broker API for live order placement and management
- Implement various order types (market, limit, stop, etc.)

## 3. Live Portfolio Management
- Enhance the Portfolio class to handle real-time position tracking
- Implement real-time risk management and position sizing

## 4. Live Strategy Execution
- Modify the Strategy base class to support real-time signal generation
- Implement a simple live trading strategy (e.g., Moving Average Crossover)

## 5. System Integration
- Integrate all components to work together in real-time
- Implement a main TradingSystem class to orchestrate the live trading process

## 6. Logging and Monitoring
- Implement comprehensive logging for all system activities
- Develop a real-time monitoring dashboard for system status and performance

## 7. Testing and Simulation
- Develop a paper trading mode for testing strategies without real money
- Implement unit tests for all components
- Conduct integration tests in a simulated live environment

## 8. Error Handling and Failsafes
- Implement robust error handling throughout the system
- Develop failsafe mechanisms to handle network issues, API failures, etc.

## 9. Performance Optimization
- Optimize data processing and event handling for low-latency operation
- Implement efficient data structures for quick access to market data and portfolio information

## 10. Documentation and Deployment
- Write detailed documentation for system setup and operation
- Develop deployment scripts and containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy setup
