# Backtester System Development Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Event Bus
   - Implement basic publish-subscribe functionality using ZeroMQ
   - Define core event types (NEW_DATA, SIGNAL, ORDER, FILL)
   - Create unit tests for event publishing and subscription
   - Estimated time: 1 week

2. Data Handler
   - Implement data loading from CSV files (start with single asset)
   - Create data cleaning and preprocessing functions
   - Implement event generation for new data
   - Develop unit tests for data loading and preprocessing
   - Estimated time: 2 weeks

## Phase 2: Strategy and Execution

3. Strategy Handler
   - Implement a basic moving average crossover strategy
   - Create a strategy base class for easy extension
   - Develop signal generation based on strategy rules
   - Write unit tests for strategy logic and signal generation
   - Estimated time: 2 weeks

4. Portfolio Handler
   - Implement basic portfolio state tracking (positions, cash balance)
   - Create simple position sizing logic
   - Develop order generation based on signals and current positions
   - Write unit tests for portfolio state management and order generation
   - Estimated time: 2 weeks

5. Order Layer
   - Implement basic market order execution
   - Add simple slippage and transaction cost models
   - Create fill event generation
   - Develop unit tests for order execution and fill event generation
   - Estimated time: 2 weeks

## Phase 3: Analysis and Optimization

6. Performance & Reporting Module
   - Implement basic performance metrics calculation (returns, Sharpe ratio)
   - Create simple performance reporting functionality
   - Develop unit tests for metric calculations
   - Estimated time: 2 weeks

7. Optimization Engine
   - Implement basic grid search for strategy parameter optimization
   - Create optimization request and result handling
   - Develop unit tests for optimization process
   - Estimated time: 2 weeks

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

8. Market Simulator
   - Implement basic random walk price generation
   - Add functionality to simulate specific market scenarios
   - Create unit tests for data generation
   - Estimated time: 2 weeks

9. Multi-Asset Support
   - Extend Data Handler to support multiple assets
   - Update Portfolio Handler for multi-asset management
   - Modify Strategy Handler to generate signals for multiple assets
   - Update unit tests for multi-asset functionality
   - Estimated time: 3 weeks

## Phase 5: Integration and Testing

10. System Integration
    - Integrate all modules through the Event Bus
    - Implement end-to-end system tests
    - Create a simple command-line interface for running backtests
    - Estimated time: 2 weeks

11. Documentation and Code Review
    - Write comprehensive documentation for each module
    - Conduct thorough code review
    - Refactor code based on review feedback
    - Estimated time: 1 week

Total Estimated Time: 21 weeks

## Next Steps and Considerations:

1. Prioritize modules based on core functionality requirements
2. Begin with the Event Bus and Data Handler as they form the foundation of the system
3. Implement a basic version of each module before moving to advanced features
4. Continuously integrate and test modules as they are developed
5. Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
6. Plan for regular code reviews and architecture discussions throughout the development process

This plan allows for iterative development, with each phase building upon the previous one. It's flexible and can be adjusted based on progress and changing requirements.
