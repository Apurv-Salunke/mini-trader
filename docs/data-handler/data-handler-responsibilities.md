# DataHandler Responsibilities

## Common Responsibilities (Live & Historical)

1. Data Abstraction
   - Provide a uniform interface for accessing data, regardless of the source (live feed or historical database)
   - Abstract away the details of data retrieval and storage

2. Data Preprocessing
   - Clean and validate incoming data
   - Handle missing data points
   - Adjust for stock splits, dividends, etc.

3. Data Normalization
   - Ensure consistent data format across different sources and symbols
   - Convert timestamps to a standard format

4. Symbol Management
   - Maintain a list of actively tracked symbols
   - Handle symbol additions and removals

5. Event Generation
   - Create and publish relevant events (e.g., NEW_PRICE_DATA, NEW_OHLC_DATA) to the EventBus

6. Error Handling
   - Manage and report data-related errors (e.g., connection issues, invalid data)

## Live Data Specific Responsibilities

1. Real-time Data Streaming
   - Connect to and manage live data feed(s)
   - Handle reconnections and data feed interruptions

2. Data Buffering
   - Maintain a short-term buffer of recent data points
   - Provide access to the most recent data without constant database queries

3. Rate Limiting
   - Manage API call rates to comply with data provider limits
   - Implement efficient data polling strategies

## Historical Data Specific Responsibilities

1. Data Storage
   - Efficiently store large volumes of historical data
   - Manage database connections and queries

2. Data Retrieval
   - Provide methods to fetch historical data for specified date ranges and symbols
   - Implement efficient data access patterns (e.g., caching frequently accessed data)

3. Backtesting Support
   - Simulate a live data feed for backtesting purposes
   - Provide iterators or generators for walking through historical data

4. Data Updates
   - Periodically update historical data with the latest available information
   - Handle incremental updates to minimize data transfer and processing

5. Data Integrity
   - Ensure consistency and accuracy of historical data
   - Implement versioning or audit trails for data changes

## Additional Considerations

1. Scalability
   - Design the DataHandler to efficiently handle a large number of symbols and high data throughput

2. Extensibility
   - Allow for easy addition of new data sources and data types

3. Configuration
   - Provide a flexible configuration system for specifying data sources, update frequencies, etc.

4. Logging and Monitoring
   - Implement comprehensive logging for all data operations
   - Provide monitoring hooks for system health and performance metrics
