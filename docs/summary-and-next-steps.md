# mini-trader Project Summary and Next Steps

## Project Overview
mini-trader is an event-driven backtesting system for trading strategies, designed with modularity and extensibility in mind.

## Work Completed

1. Project Structure:
   - Set up basic directory structure for source code, tests, and documentation.
   - Created setup.py for package management.

2. Event System:
   - Implemented Event class with various event types.
   - Designed EventBus class (implementation pending).
   - Created comprehensive tests for Event class.
   - Prepared tests for EventBus class (to be implemented).

3. Code Quality:
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for automated checks.
   - Configured Black for code formatting.
   - Configured isort for import sorting.
   - Set up Ruff for linting.
   - Created pyproject.toml and .pre-commit-config.yaml for tool configurations.

4. Dependencies:
   - Created requirements.txt with necessary packages.

5. Version Control:
   - Initialized git repository.
   - Made initial commits for project structure and code.

## Next Steps

1. Implement EventBus Class:
   - Create EventBus class in src/mini_trader/event_bus/bus.py.
   - Implement methods for publishing events, subscribing to event types, and unsubscribing.
   - Set up asynchronous event processing using a separate thread.
   - Implement a queue for storing events.

2. Test EventBus Implementation:
   - Run existing tests in test_bus.py.
   - Debug and fix any issues until all tests pass.
   - Add additional tests if needed to ensure comprehensive coverage.

3. Data Handling:
   - Design and implement a DataHandler class for managing market data.
   - Create tests for the DataHandler class.

4. Strategy Implementation:
   - Design a base Strategy class.
   - Implement a simple strategy (e.g., Moving Average Crossover) as an example.
   - Create tests for strategy classes.

5. Portfolio Management:
   - Design and implement a Portfolio class for tracking positions and performing risk management.
   - Create tests for the Portfolio class.

6. Execution Simulation:
   - Implement an OrderExecutor class for simulating order execution in backtests.
   - Create tests for the OrderExecutor class.

7. Performance Analysis:
   - Design and implement classes for calculating and reporting performance metrics.
   - Create tests for performance analysis classes.

8. Integration:
   - Bring all components together in a main Backtester class.
   - Create integration tests to ensure all parts work together correctly.

9. Documentation:
   - Write detailed documentation for each module.
   - Create a user guide with examples of how to use the system.

10. Optimization and Enhancements:
    - Implement parallel processing for improved performance in backtests.
    - Add support for multiple asset classes.
    - Implement more advanced risk management features.

Remember to run code quality checks (pre-commit, Black, isort, Ruff) regularly and keep the requirements.txt file updated as new dependencies are added.
